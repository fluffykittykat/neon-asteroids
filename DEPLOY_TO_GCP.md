# Deploying Neon Asteroids to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This guide will help you deploy your application to **Google Cloud Run**, which allows you to run stateless containers that are invocable via web requests.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Google Cloud SDK**: You need the `gcloud` command-line tool.
    *   [Download and Install Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2.  **GCP Project**: You need a Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initialize Google Cloud SDK
Open your terminal (PowerShell) and run:
```powershell
gcloud init
```
Follow the prompts to log in and select your project.

### 2. Enable Required Services
Cloud Run and Artifact Registry (for storing container images) need to be enabled:
```powershell
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```

### 3. Deploy to Cloud Run
You can deploy directly from your source code using a single command. Cloud Run will use Google Cloud Build to build your Docker image and then deploy it.

Run the following command in the project root:

```powershell
gcloud run deploy neon-asteroids --source . --port 8080 --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDJ59L7nRuoVZ0b0kh9FXahXA1XtSAGKuM
```

**Explanation of flags:**
*   `--source .`: Tells Cloud Run to build the container from the current directory (using your `Dockerfile`).
*   `--port 8080`: Specifies that your container listens on port 8080 (which matches your `nginx.conf`).
*   `--region us-central1`: Deploys to the US Central region (you can change this to a region closer to you).
*   `--allow-unauthenticated`: Makes your application publicly accessible over the internet.

### 4. Access Your App
After the deployment finishes, the terminal will output a **Service URL** (e.g., `https://neon-asteroids-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app`). Click that link to play your game!

## Troubleshooting

*   **Build Failures**: View the build logs provided in the terminal link if the deployment fails.
*   **Port Issues**: Ensure `nginx.conf` is listening on 8080 (it currently is).
